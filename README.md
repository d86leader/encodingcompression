# encodingcompression labs
Use ./main encoding_mode files...

Currently availdible encoding modes:

	* haffman_e: encode file2 haffmanly based on probabilities in file1
probablities are of format:
> 0.5 a
> 0.25 b
> and so on
	
* haffman_d: decode file2 based on probabilities in file1, which are of format described above
